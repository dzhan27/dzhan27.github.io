                                    <h5>Sept 2020 - Jun 2023 | Ithaca, New York</h5>
                                    <p>I worked with a team of ~70 undergraduate engineers to design and build a rover to compete
                                        in the annual University Rover Challenge. Some tasks these rovers compete in include performing
                                        various dexterous operations with the arm and end effector, including inserting
                                        USB sticks and typing on keyboards. However, our deprecated ROS 1 Forward-Kinematics based control
                                        scheme made it difficult for us to score well on these tasks. To combat this, I implemented an 
                                        Inverse-Kinematics based control scheme in ROS 2 and C++ to give arm operators direct control over the 
                                        position and orientation of the end effector, improving our performance in the most complicated
                                        tasks. I also re-implemented a Forward-Kinematics based control scheme with more precise joint
                                        control as a fallback option during competition.

                                    <h5>Sept 2022 - May 2023 | Ithaca, NY</h5>
                                    <p>I expanded upon 2D and 3D simulations modelling the magnetohydrodynamic flow of
                                        ablating plasma. I used Fortran 90 to simulate magnetic fields 
                                        ablating solid aluminum and manipulating the resulting plasma into a coherent
                                        jet. I utilized explicit concurrent programming in the simulation over 32 space cells (corresponding
                                        to 32 computational cores available in the simulating computer) with interacting boundaries
                                        to reduce simulation runtime from a week to 5 hours.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>Coherent plasma jets have applications to nuclear fusion energy.
                                        For example, a basic way to induce nuclear fusion is to point two jets of fusible material
                                        in extreme temperature and pressure conditions towards each other. The particulate
                                        kinetic energy from the resulting fusion reaction can be collected and used to generate electricity.

                                    <h5>Sept 2021 - May 2023 | Ithaca, NY</h5>
                                    <p>I developed a computational quantum dynamics model of the NV center. The simulation
                                        focuses on quantifying the rate of photoluminescent (PL) transitions. The NV center
                                        is excited with a laser, then allowed to relax under varying magnetic field conditions.
                                        A near-resonant magnetic field was found to reduce the rate of PL transitions by about 20%.
                                        This program is written in Python using the QuTiP (Quantum Toolbox in Python) library.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The NV center is a point defect in the diamond carbon lattice, where one carbon
                                        atom is completely removed and an adjacent carbon atom is replaced with a nitrogen atom.
                                        The resulting defect, if negatively charged, has PL transitions. (i.e. You can see when the 
                                        state of the defect changes, because it emits photons when this happens!) We found
                                        that a pulsing magnetic field with frequency near resonance
                                        reduces the rate of PL transitions. This could allow us to use the NV center as a
                                        quantum sensor; we theoretically could put this point defect somewhere and simply look at it 
                                        to determine if a magnetic field of that frequency exists there.

                                    <p>I developed a Surface Ion Trap Chip tester to automate testing of Honeywell Quantum’s 
                                        surface electrode traps. This program is written in Python and interfaces with NI measurement chasse 
                                        to measure said traps' electrical characteristics. It includes a live hardware calibration, capacitance and resistance
                                        tests, a histogram plotter to visualize data, and a GUI for less software-savvy users. It reduces
                                        testing time by over 90%, personnel needed to test the trap by 100% (wow!), and scales linearly
                                        with trap size - which will be important when Honeywell Quantum makes larger and more sophisticated 
                                        ion traps.</p>
